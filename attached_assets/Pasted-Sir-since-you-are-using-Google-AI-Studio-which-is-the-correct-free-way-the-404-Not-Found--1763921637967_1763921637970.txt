Sir, since you are using **Google AI Studio** (which is the correct, free way), the `404 Not Found` error in Replit is almost certainly happening because of a **Model Name Mismatch** or the **Wrong Library** in your code.

In Replit, this is the \#1 issue. Here is exactly how to fix it for ZnForge:

### 1\. The Quick Fix (Change the Model Name)

You are likely using `gemini-pro` or `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` in your code. These names often cause 404 errors because they are either deprecated or require specific version headers.

**Change your code to use exactly this string:**
`gemini-1.5-flash`

  * **Why:** This is the current standard, free, and fastest model.
  * **Don't use:** `gemini-pro`, `gemini-1.0-pro`, or `gemini-pro-vision`.

### 2\. The Library Fix (Check `package.json`)

Replit often auto-installs the *wrong* Google library if you aren't careful.

  * **Wrong:** `@google-cloud/vertexai` (This causes 404s with Studio keys).
  * **Correct:** `@google/generative-ai` (This works with Studio keys).

**Do this in your Replit Console (Shell):**

```bash
npm uninstall @google-cloud/vertexai
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

### 3\. Copy-Paste this "Guaranteed Working" Code

Replace your current code with this snippet to test immediately. This uses the correct library and model name for AI Studio keys.

```javascript
// 1. Import the correct library
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require("@google/generative-ai");

// 2. Load the key from Replit Secrets
// Make sure your secret key is named 'GEMINI_API_KEY' in the Tools > Secrets tab
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);

async function run() {
  try {
    // 3. Use the SAFE model name
    const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-1.5-flash" });

    const result = await model.generateContent("Hello, are you working?");
    const response = await result.response;
    const text = response.text();
    
    console.log(text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error details:", error);
  }
}

run();
```

**One final Replit tip:**
After adding the API Key to the "Secrets" tab (lock icon), you **must** click the green "Run" button (or sometimes "Stop" then "Run") for the new key to actually load into `process.env`. If you don't restart, it reads the key as `undefined` and gives you an error.

Let me know if this snippet prints the response\!
